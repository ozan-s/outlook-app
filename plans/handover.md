- **Key Challenge**: Implement streaming display for --all flag with large result sets
- **Estimated**: 3 hours
- **Foundation Ready**: Resource monitoring infrastructure already available

## Critical Context
Windows testing revealed and fixed production-critical issues:
- Defensive COM programming patterns now established for corporate environments
- Enhanced error reporting with detailed diagnostics operational
- CLI --limit argument added to read command per user request
- Security validation complete - no known vulnerabilities

## Recent Achievements
- Transformed Windows validation from 11.1% → 66.7% → 100% success rate
- Resolved critical security vulnerabilities in CLI argument handling
- Established reusable Windows testing patterns for future checkpoints
- Added comprehensive error analysis with suggested fixes

## Available Infrastructure
- Enhanced test frameworks with detailed error reporting
- Performance monitoring (PerformanceMonitor, AuditLogger, ResourceMonitor)
- Progressive filtering optimization already implemented
- Security validation patterns established
- Defensive COM programming patterns documented in CLAUDE.md
