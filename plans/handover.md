- **System State**: CLI foundation complete with argparse routing, all business logic services working, 92 tests passing
- **Phase Status**: Phase 3 (CLI Interface Layer) STARTED - framework ready, commands need service integration
- **No Blockers**: CLI framework ready for service integration

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 009
- **Description**: Read command implementation
- **Key Challenge**: Integrate EmailReader + Paginator services with CLI command
- **Estimated**: 3 hours

## CLI Foundation Ready
- **Command Framework**: argparse-based CLI with routing for all 4 commands (read, find, move, open)
- **Help System**: Complete help for main CLI and individual commands
- **Console Script**: `uv run outlook-cli` working via pyproject.toml entry point
- **Interface Contract**: Command signatures finalized for remaining milestones
- **Test Patterns**: 14 CLI tests established covering parsing, routing, help, integration

## Critical Context
- **Zero Dependencies**: Used stdlib argparse, no external CLI framework needed
- **Service Integration Ready**: EmailReader, EmailSearcher, EmailMover, Paginator all working and tested
- **Placeholder Handlers**: CLI routes to functions that currently print status - ready for service calls
