# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 011: Move command implementation ✅
- **System State**: All 3 core CLI commands (read, find, move) working with full EmailReader/EmailSearcher/EmailMover service integration
- **Test Coverage**: 114 tests passing, 95% coverage, comprehensive CLI integration testing established
- **No Blockers**: All service layer foundations complete, CLI patterns perfected, ready for final command

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 012
- **Description**: Open command implementation 
- **Key Challenge**: Email content display formatting (no complex service logic needed)
- **Estimated**: 2 hours (patterns established, straightforward implementation)

## Critical Context
- **CLI Integration Pattern**: Service → Handler → Output format perfected across read/find/move commands
- **TDD Efficiency**: Established patterns allow faster implementation (Move completed in 2 hours vs 3 estimated)
- **Service Layer Complete**: EmailReader/EmailSearcher/EmailMover trilogy provides full email management foundation
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit + integration + manual verification pattern catches all issues systematically
- **Error Handling**: ValueError → user-friendly messages standardized across all commands

## Technical Foundation Ready
- MockOutlookAdapter with rich test data for all email operations
- Paginator for consistent result display
- Three-layer CLI architecture (service → handler → output)
- Comprehensive test coverage with established patterns
- All core business logic services implemented and tested

## Development Velocity
Phase 3 (CLI Interface Layer) completing ahead of schedule due to:
- Established service integration patterns
- Reusable CLI error handling 
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Clean three-layer architecture

**Next session can immediately begin Milestone 012 implementation**
