# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 011B: Comprehensive Integration Testing and Edge Cases âœ…
- **System State**: All 351 tests passing, comprehensive security and edge case coverage added, real integration testing established
- **No Blockers**: All integration points validated and working correctly

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 011C
- **Description**: Performance Validation and Security Review
- **Key Challenge**: Establish performance baselines and implement security hardening
- **Estimated**: 3 hours

## Critical Context
Testing infrastructure is now fully updated for the new service architecture from 011A. The comprehensive testing foundation established in 011B provides:
- Security vulnerability coverage (injection attacks, Unicode, memory limits)
- Real integration testing patterns using MockOutlookAdapter
- Performance validation baseline (sub-second operations confirmed)

Next session can focus purely on performance optimization and security hardening without coverage gaps.
