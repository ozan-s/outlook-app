## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 013: Streaming output for large result sets âœ…
- **System State**: --all flag provides streaming output, --limit flag unchanged (backward compatibility)
- **Production Ready**: All functionality validated with 33 comprehensive tests
- **No Blockers**: Streaming infrastructure complete and working

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 014
- **Description**: Performance optimization and large mailbox handling  
- **Key Challenge**: Windows COM-specific optimizations for enterprise mailboxes (10K+ emails)
- **Estimated**: 3 hours (reduced scope - streaming infrastructure already complete)
- **Foundation Ready**: Streaming infrastructure, resource monitoring, progressive filtering all available

## Critical Context
Streaming implementation established new capabilities:
- --all flag bypasses pagination, provides memory-safe streaming display
- --limit flag unchanged (100% backward compatibility maintained)
- Large result warnings (>1000 emails) and progress indication (>100 emails)
- Comprehensive test coverage (33 tests) validates all functionality
- CLI Streaming vs Pagination Pattern documented in CLAUDE.md

## Available Infrastructure
- StreamingResultDisplay and StreamingPaginator classes for large result handling
- Resource monitoring with memory limits and progress indication
- CLI argument standardization with shared builders and mutually exclusive groups
- Performance monitoring (PerformanceMonitor, AuditLogger, ResourceMonitor)
- Progressive filtering optimization and defensive COM programming patterns
