# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 006: Email Filtering Service with Attachment/Read Status Filters ✅
- **System State**: All four filter types implemented and working (read status, attachments, importance, exclusions)
- **No Blockers**: Ready to proceed with sorting and pagination enhancements

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 007
- **Description**: Sorting and pagination service enhancements
- **Key Challenge**: Add sorting by multiple fields and pagination control to services
- **Estimated**: 3 hours

## Major Breakthrough from Milestone 006
- **Service & CLI Integration**: Successfully integrated service layer filtering with CLI argument passing
- **Performance Validated**: Sub-second filtering with 1000+ emails meets requirements  
- **Test Coverage**: 25 tests passing, comprehensive filtering functionality delivered
- **Milestone 009 Eliminated**: Enhanced find command integration completed within this milestone
- **Foundation Complete**: All filtering infrastructure ready for Windows Testing Checkpoint #2

## What Was Delivered
- ✅ **Four Filter Methods**: `filter_by_read_status()`, `filter_by_attachments()`, `filter_by_importance()`, `filter_by_exclusions()`
- ✅ **Enhanced Search Integration**: `search_emails()` method supports all new filter parameters
- ✅ **CLI Connection**: `handle_find()` passes all parsed arguments to service layer
- ✅ **Progressive Filtering Pattern**: Maintainable sequential filter application documented in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **Performance Proven**: All operations < 0.001s with 1000 email dataset

## Foundation Status
All email filtering functionality is now **complete and tested**:
- Service layer methods handle all filter types with proper validation
- CLI argument parsing connected to service methods
- Progressive filtering pattern provides maintainable, testable code
- Performance validated for large datasets
- Ready for sorting/pagination enhancements and Windows validation
