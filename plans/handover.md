# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 007: Sorting and Pagination Service Enhancements ✅
- **System State**: EmailSortingService fully implemented, both find and read commands support sorting, all integration tested
- **No Blockers**: Ready to proceed with either Windows validation or additional filtering features

## Next Milestone Options
- **Primary**: Milestone 010: Windows Testing Checkpoint #2 - Core Filtering Validation
- **Alternative**: Milestone 011: Enhanced read command with filtering support (reduced scope - sorting already complete)
- **Key Challenge**: Windows environment validation of complete filtering+sorting system
- **Estimated**: 2-3 hours

## Major Breakthrough from Milestone 007
- **Service Pattern Success**: Service-to-CLI Integration Pattern scales excellently to sorting functionality
- **TDD Effectiveness**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle prevented common edge cases and delivered robust solution
- **Performance Validated**: All sorting operations maintain sub-second performance with 1000+ emails
- **Integration Proven**: Sorting + filtering + pagination work seamlessly together with zero conflicts
- **CLI Consistency**: Both find and read commands now have identical sorting capabilities

## What Was Delivered
- ✅ **EmailSortingService**: Complete service supporting received_date, subject, sender, importance fields
- ✅ **CLI Integration**: --sort-by and --sort-order flags added to both find and read commands
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 8 tests covering unit, functional, and integration scenarios
- ✅ **Performance Confirmed**: Sub-second sorting with large datasets
- ✅ **Master Plan Updated**: Milestone 011 scope reduced due to sorting integration completion
