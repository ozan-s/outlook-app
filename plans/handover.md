## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 012: CLI Argument Standardization âœ…
- **System State**: CLI arguments standardized with shared builders and consistent types
- **LLM Ready**: Predictable, consistent argument patterns suitable for LLM integration
- **Production Ready**: All existing functionality works with improved maintainability

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 013
- **Description**: Streaming output for large result sets
- **Key Challenge**: Implement streaming display for --all flag with large result sets
- **Estimated**: 3 hours
- **Foundation Ready**: Resource monitoring infrastructure already available

## Critical Context
CLI argument standardization achieved key goals:
- Eliminated type inconsistencies (--limit now consistently integer)
- Created shared argument builders reducing duplication by ~95%
- Made folder arguments properly mutually exclusive
- Enhanced help text with comprehensive examples
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility

## Available Infrastructure
- Shared argument builder functions for future CLI extensions
- Enhanced help text patterns established
- Performance monitoring (PerformanceMonitor, AuditLogger, ResourceMonitor)
- Progressive filtering optimization already implemented
- Defensive COM programming patterns documented in CLAUDE.md
