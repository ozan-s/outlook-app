## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 011C: Performance Validation and Security Review ✅
- **System State**: Enterprise monitoring infrastructure complete, 407 tests passing, zero regressions
- **No Blockers**: All performance monitoring, audit logging, and resource limits operational

## Next Milestone  
- **Number**: Milestone 010
- **Description**: Windows Testing Checkpoint #2 - Core Filtering Validation
- **Status**: ✅ PLANNED - Ready for `/build`
- **Plan File**: `/plans/milestone-010-windows-testing-checkpoint-2.md`

## Critical Context
Technical debt resolution phase (011A-011C) successfully completed. System now has:
- Performance monitoring with automatic regression detection
- Audit logging for all filter operations (configurable)
- Resource limits preventing system exhaustion
- Progressive filtering optimization (2x-5x performance improvement available)
- Enterprise-grade monitoring patterns documented in CLAUDE.md

All components follow established Service-to-CLI Integration Pattern and maintain full backward compatibility.
