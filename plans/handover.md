# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 004: Folder enumeration service and adapter methods âœ…
- **System State**: 
  - FolderService class implemented with hierarchy organization
  - CLI `folders` command works with both tree and flat views
  - All tests passing (5 new tests added)
- **No Blockers**: All functionality working correctly

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 005
- **Description**: Windows Testing Checkpoint #1 - COM Interface Validation
- **Key Challenge**: Generate comprehensive test script for Windows machine to validate COM interface
- **Estimated**: 2 hours

## Critical Context
The folder enumeration system is now complete and follows the established Service-to-CLI Integration Pattern. The FolderService handles the complex logic of organizing flat folder lists into hierarchical structures, while the CLI simply calls the service methods for display formatting.

Key patterns established:
- Service layer organizes data (hierarchy, levels)
- Service provides formatted output strings
- CLI integrates service via single method calls
- Integration tests validate with real adapter data

Next session should focus on Windows testing checkpoint to validate the COM interface works correctly with real Outlook before proceeding to email filtering services.
