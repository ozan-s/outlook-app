# Session Handover

## Current State
- **Last Completed**: Milestone 001: Enhanced CLI Argument Parser with New Filter Flags âœ…
- **System State**: All 16 new CLI flags parsing correctly, folders command working, full backward compatibility
- **No Blockers**: CLI infrastructure is solid, ready for service layer integration

## Next Milestone
- **Number**: Milestone 003 (skipping 002 - already completed)
- **Description**: Relative date parsing and validation
- **Key Challenge**: Parse relative dates (7d, 2w, yesterday) into absolute datetime objects
- **Estimated**: 3 hours

## Critical Context
- Milestone 002 (flag conflict detection) was completed in Milestone 001 using argparse mutually exclusive groups
- Basic folders command and tree view also completed - much simpler than expected
- Master plan updated to reflect scope reductions and completed functionality
- All existing tests still pass, no regression introduced

## Ready for Next Session
Next session can immediately start on:
1. Milestone 003: Relative date parsing implementation
2. Service layer has solid CLI foundation to build on
3. All argument parsing patterns established and documented in CLAUDE.md
