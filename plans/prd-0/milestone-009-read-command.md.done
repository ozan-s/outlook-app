# Milestone 009: Read Command Implementation

## Objective
Implement `read [folder]` command with EmailReader integration and pagination support.

## Current State Analysis
- Dependency check: ✅ EmailReader service working (milestone 004)
- Dependency check: ✅ Paginator class working (milestone 007) 
- Dependency check: ✅ CLI framework working (milestone 008)
- Current CLI handler: Placeholder `handle_read(args)` in `src/outlook_cli/cli.py:89`
- EmailReader API: `get_emails_from_folder(folder_path: str) -> List[Email]`
- Paginator API: Constructor takes `List[Email]`, provides navigation and page info
- Test patterns: Established TestClass/TestClassIntegration naming, MockOutlookAdapter usage

## Success Criteria
- [x] `outlook-cli read Inbox` displays first 10 emails from Inbox
- [x] `outlook-cli read "Sent Items"` handles folder names with spaces  
- [x] Invalid folder names show helpful error message
- [x] Pagination shows page info (Page 1 of 3, showing 1-10 of 25 emails)
- [x] Integration: Works end-to-end with MockOutlookAdapter test data

## Implementation Approach

### TDD Sequence
1. **Test**: Read valid folder → displays first page of emails with pagination info
2. **Test**: Read folder with spaces → handles quoted folder names correctly
3. **Test**: Read non-existent folder → shows user-friendly error message
4. **Test**: Read folder with >10 emails → shows only first 10 with pagination info
5. **Test**: Read empty folder → shows "No emails found" message

### Integration Points
- CLI Framework: Replace placeholder `handle_read(args)` implementation
- EmailReader: Use `get_emails_from_folder(args.folder)` to fetch emails
- Paginator: Wrap email list for 10-item pages and navigation info
- MockOutlookAdapter: Test with pre-populated folder data

### Error Handling
- EmailReader raises `ValueError` for invalid folders → convert to user-friendly CLI message
- Handle folder names with spaces via proper argument parsing
- Empty result sets should show helpful "No emails found" message

### Evidence for Completion
- All unit and integration tests passing
- Manual verification:
  ```bash
  uv run outlook-cli read Inbox
  uv run outlook-cli read "Sent Items"  
  uv run outlook-cli read NonExistentFolder
  ```
- Output shows properly formatted email list with pagination info
- Error cases display helpful user messages

## Notes
- Use existing MockOutlookAdapter test data for realistic testing
- Follow established CLI test patterns from milestone 008
- Pagination navigation (next/prev) will come in future milestone - this milestone shows current page only
- Output format should be clean and readable (email subject, sender, date)

## Progress
- [x] TDD Test 1: Read valid folder displays emails with pagination info
- [x] TDD Test 2: Read folder with spaces handles quoted names correctly  
- [x] TDD Test 3: Read non-existent folder shows user-friendly error message
- [x] TDD Test 4: Read folder with >10 emails shows only first 10 with pagination info
- [x] TDD Test 5: Read empty folder shows "No emails found" message
- [x] Integration tests: End-to-end CLI with MockOutlookAdapter
- [x] Manual verification: All CLI commands working as expected
- [x] All tests passing (100/100)

## Final Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Delivered
- Working read command with EmailReader + Paginator integration
- Clean CLI output with pagination info and email details
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid folders and edge cases
- Full test suite (8 tests) covering unit and integration scenarios
- Manual verification completed for all success criteria

### Master Plan Updated
- Marked Milestone 009 complete ✅ 2024-06-28
- No scope changes needed - all patterns established for remaining CLI commands
- Efficiency insight: Milestones 010-012 may complete faster due to established patterns

### Git Commit
- Hash: 315e7b9
- Message: "feat: implement read command with EmailReader and Paginator integration"

### Handover Notes
Read command fully working with all integration patterns established. Next session can:
1. Start Milestone 010: Find command implementation  
2. Follow identical CLI integration pattern established
3. Reuse pagination display and error handling patterns
4. No blockers - all service layer dependencies working perfectly
