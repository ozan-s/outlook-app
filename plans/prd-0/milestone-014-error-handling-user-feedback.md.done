# Milestone 014: Error Handling + User Feedback

## Objective
Implement comprehensive error handling infrastructure with user-friendly messages and centralized logging

## Current State Analysis
- **Dependency check**: ✅ All CLI commands, services, and adapters complete
- **Error handling foundation**: ✅ Consistent ValueError → CLI pattern established
- **PyWin32Adapter logging**: ✅ Basic logging infrastructure exists
- **Existing patterns**: Three-layer error handling (COM → Adapter → Service → CLI)

**Current Error Message Examples**:
```
Error: Folder 'InBox' not found
Error: Email '123' not found  
Error searching emails: [exception message]
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Centralized logging configuration across all components ✅
- [x] Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance ✅
- [x] Connection health monitoring with auto-reconnection ✅
- [x] Timeout handling for long-running operations ✅
- [x] Error categorization system (transient vs permanent) ✅
- [x] Improved error context with recovery suggestions ✅

## Implementation Approach

### TDD Sequence
1. **Test**: Centralized logging configuration writes to file and console
2. **Test**: Enhanced error messages provide recovery suggestions
3. **Test**: Connection health monitoring detects Outlook unavailable
4. **Test**: Timeout handling cancels long operations gracefully
5. **Test**: Error categorization enables different response strategies
6. **Test**: CLI shows helpful guidance for common error scenarios

### Integration Points
- **Logging**: New centralized logging.py module integrated into all components
- **Error handling**: Enhanced error classes with categorization and context
- **CLI layer**: Improved error message formatting with recovery suggestions
- **Adapter layer**: Connection health monitoring and timeout handling
- **Service layer**: Error enrichment with business context

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Centralized Logging Infrastructure
```python
# src/outlook_cli/utils/logging.py
- Configure structured logging with console + file output
- Log levels: INFO for user actions, DEBUG for detailed operations
- Consistent format across all components
```

#### 2. Enhanced Error Classes
```python
# src/outlook_cli/utils/errors.py
- OutlookError base class with categorization
- ConnectionError, TimeoutError, ValidationError subclasses
- Error context with recovery suggestions
```

#### 3. Connection Health Monitoring  
```python
# src/outlook_cli/utils/connection_monitor.py
- Proactive Outlook connection checking
- Auto-reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when Outlook unavailable
```

#### 4. Timeout Handling
```python
# Add timeout decorators for long operations
- Configurable timeouts for folder operations
- Progress indicators for batch operations
- Cancellation support for user interruption
```

#### 5. Enhanced CLI Error Messages
```python
# Improved error messages with suggestions:
"Error: Folder 'InBox' not found. Did you mean 'Inbox'? Use 'read --help' to see available folders."
"Error: Connection to Outlook failed. Please ensure Outlook is running and try again."
"Error: Operation timed out after 30s. Large folders may take longer to process."
```

## Evidence for Completion
- **Logging verification**: `outlook_cli.log` file created with structured entries
- **Error message testing**: CLI commands show enhanced error messages with recovery guidance
- **Connection monitoring**: Adapter detects and handles Outlook connection failures
- **Timeout handling**: Long operations respect timeout limits and provide user feedback
- **Integration testing**: All existing CLI commands continue working with enhanced error handling
- **Manual testing**: Simulate error conditions (Outlook closed, invalid inputs) and verify user experience

## Final Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Delivered
- **Centralized Logging Infrastructure**: File + console output with structured format
- **Enhanced Error Classes**: OutlookError with categorization and contextual suggestions  
- **Connection Health Monitoring**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Handling**: Progress tracking, cancellation, configurable timeouts
- **Enhanced CLI Error Messages**: Recovery suggestions integrated into all commands
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 71 new utility tests + all 204 existing tests passing

### Integration Validated
- All CLI commands enhanced with logging and better error messages
- Backward compatibility maintained - existing error patterns preserved
- Error handling integrates cleanly with service layer and adapter patterns
- Manual validation confirms enhanced UX with recovery suggestions

### Master Plan Updated
- Marked Milestone 014 complete ✅ 2024-06-28
- Confirmed Milestone 015 scope minimal (core formatting/UX already complete)
- No new milestones needed - error infrastructure complete and production-ready

### Git Commits
- Centralized logging: feat: implement centralized logging configuration
- Enhanced errors: feat: implement enhanced error classes with categorization  
- Connection monitoring: feat: implement connection health monitoring with auto-reconnection
- Timeout handling: feat: implement timeout handling with progress tracking and cancellation
- CLI integration: feat: integrate enhanced error handling into CLI commands

### Handover Notes
Error handling infrastructure fully operational. All CLI commands now provide:
- Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Enhanced error messages with recovery suggestions
- Consistent error handling across all operations
- Connection monitoring and timeout capabilities ready for production

Next session can proceed directly to Milestone 015 (minimal CLI polish) with robust error handling foundation in place.
