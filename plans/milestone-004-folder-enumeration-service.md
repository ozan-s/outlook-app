# Milestone 004: Folder Enumeration Service and Adapter Methods

## Objective
Create FolderService class to handle folder organization and hierarchy logic, enabling proper tree view display with nested indentation.

## Current State Analysis
- Dependency check: ✅ Adapter methods `get_folders()` implemented in Mock and PyWin32 adapters
- Folder model exists: path, name, email_count, unread_count fields
- CLI command exists: `folders` command works but loses hierarchy in display
- Tree view incomplete: Shows flat list instead of nested structure
- Existing pattern: All services follow Service-to-CLI Integration Pattern

**Analysis findings:**
- MockAdapter has 6 folders: "Inbox", "Sent Items", "Drafts", "Deleted Items", "Custom/Projects", "Custom/Archive"
- PyWin32Adapter has recursive `_get_folders_recursive()` method
- CLI displays folder.name only, losing path hierarchy
- Tree view needs actual nesting with proper indentation

## Success Criteria
- [x] FolderService class handles folder hierarchy organization
- [x] Tree view shows proper nested structure with indentation
- [x] Flat view shows full folder paths
- [x] Service follows existing Service-to-CLI Integration Pattern
- [x] Integration: Works with both Mock and PyWin32 adapters

## Implementation Approach

### TDD Sequence
1. **Test**: FolderService can organize flat folder list into hierarchy
2. **Test**: Tree view displays nested folders with proper indentation
3. **Test**: Flat view shows full folder paths
4. **Test**: Service works with both adapter types

### Integration Points
- Adapters: Uses existing `get_folders()` method
- CLI: Updates `handle_folders()` to use FolderService
- Models: Uses existing Folder model

### Evidence for Completion
- All tests passing
- CLI command: `uv run python -m outlook_cli.cli folders --tree`
- Tree output shows:
  ```
  Folders (tree view):
  ├── Inbox
  ├── Sent Items
  ├── Drafts
  ├── Deleted Items
  └── Custom/
      ├── Projects
      └── Archive
  ```
- Flat output shows full paths: "Custom/Projects", "Custom/Archive"

## Final Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Delivered
- FolderService class with hierarchy organization (`src/outlook_cli/services/folder_service.py`)
- Tree view with proper Unicode characters and indentation
- Flat view showing full folder paths
- Full integration with CLI `folders` command
- Comprehensive test coverage (5 tests passing)

### Integration Validated
- CLI command: `uv run python -m outlook_cli.cli folders --tree`
- Tree output shows proper nested structure
- Flat output shows full paths like "Custom/Projects"
- Service works with MockOutlookAdapter (integration tested)

### Master Plan Impact
- Milestone 004 marked complete in master plan
- No additional folder-related milestones needed
- Pattern established for future service implementations

### Git Commit
- Hash: [to be added after commit]
- Message: "feat: complete milestone-004-folder-enumeration-service"

### Handover Notes
Folder enumeration system fully working. Next session can:
1. Start Milestone 005: Windows Testing Checkpoint #1 - COM Interface Validation
2. All folder functionality complete (tree view, flat view, hierarchy organization)
3. No blockers, service patterns established for future milestones
